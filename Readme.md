## Problem Statement

> An **image hosting service** allows individuals to upload images to an Internet website. The image host will then store the image onto its server, and show the individual different types of code to allow others to view that image.  
> Prior to the development of image hosting services, the display and exchange of images on the early public Internet of the 1980s-1990s was a laborious and difficult process. Before the world wide web was developed, images would primarily be downloaded manually from file servers or from [binary newsgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup#Binary_newsgroups) on [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet), and displayed with a separate image viewer. The rise of the world wide web in the 1990s brought text and images together, allowing for inline display of images without separate downloading.  
> When you want to share a photo or a gallery with friends, family, a message board, or even the entire Internet, an image hosting site is the best way to upload, store, and share your files. However, there are many image hosting sites, all with different features.
> [IMGUR](https://imgur.com/) is the internet's most loved image hosting website because it lets you store as many photos as you like without having them deleted until you decide you want them gone. It's simple, easy to use, provides with various features and above all it's free. Also another beauty of the app is that it works as well without logging in or signing up.
> It has a massive user base with support for popular image formats and user comments. It's actually more of a central hub for storing and sharing photos than just a simple image hosting service.
> It is the place where youâ€™ll find the funniest, most informative and inspiring images, memes, GIFs, and visual stories served up in an endless stream of bite-sized fun. Powered by a passionate community of people from all around the world, anyone can join to share cool stuff and vote the best to the top
> In addition to storing your photos, Imgur lets you crop and resize pictures as well as adjust other advanced settings through its online editor.
> We're going to build a similar app today for our MileStone.
